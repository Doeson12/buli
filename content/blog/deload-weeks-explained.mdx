Ask most lifters what drives progress, and they'll say "train harder." While training intensity matters, **strategic recovery** is equally critical. Enter the deload week—a planned reduction in training volume and intensity.

## What is a Deload?

A deload is a scheduled period (typically one week) where training stress is significantly reduced to allow:
- **Physiological recovery:** Muscle repair, nervous system restoration
- **Psychological break:** Mental refreshment
- **Injury prevention:** Reduced cumulative fatigue
- **Supercompensation:** Returning stronger after the break

Typical deload structure: **40-60% reduction in volume** while maintaining intensity at moderate levels (60-70% of working loads).

## Why You Need Deloads

### 1. Fatigue Accumulation

Training creates fatigue in multiple systems:
- **Local muscular fatigue:** Muscle fiber damage, glycogen depletion
- **Systemic fatigue:** Nervous system stress, hormonal disruption
- **Psychological fatigue:** Mental burnout, motivation loss

Fatigue accumulates faster than most realize. Without planned recovery, you enter a state of **overreaching** (temporary performance decline) or worse, **overtraining** (long-term breakdown).

### 2. Injury Prevention

Most injuries aren't from single "bad reps" but cumulative stress on tissues:
- Tendons and ligaments adapt slower than muscles
- Chronic inflammation from constant training
- Compensatory movement patterns from fatigue

Deloads reduce mechanical stress, allowing connective tissue to catch up.

### 3. Enhanced Adaptation

Adaptation doesn't happen during training—it happens during recovery. The *fitness-fatigue model* shows:
- Training creates both fitness (adaptation) and fatigue
- Fatigue masks fitness gains in the short term
- Reducing fatigue reveals accumulated fitness

A well-timed deload lets your body "realize" the progress you've made.

## When to Deload

### Scheduled Deloads

Standard recommendation: **Every 4-6 weeks**, depending on:
- Training intensity (higher intensity = more frequent)
- Volume (more volume = more fatigue)
- Experience (advanced lifters accumulate fatigue faster)

Buli defaults to 5-week cycles: 4 weeks progressive overload, 1 week deload.

### Reactive Deloads

Sometimes you need an unscheduled deload. Triggers include:
- **Performance decline:** Can't hit usual loads/reps for 2+ sessions
- **High RPE:** Consistent RPE 9-10 despite adequate load
- **Poor recovery indicators:** Elevated morning HR, sleep issues, persistent soreness
- **Motivation loss:** Training feels like a chore

Buli detects these patterns and suggests early deloads.

## How to Deload

### Option 1: Volume Reduction (Recommended)

- **Keep intensity:** Use similar loads (60-75% of working weight)
- **Cut volume:** 50% reduction (e.g., 4 sets → 2 sets, or 10 reps → 5 reps)
- **Why:** Maintains neuromuscular efficiency without accumulated fatigue

Example:
- Normal week: Squat 100kg, 4×8
- Deload week: Squat 80kg, 2×5

### Option 2: Intensity Reduction

- **Keep volume:** Same sets/reps
- **Reduce load:** 40-50% lighter weight
- **Why:** Active recovery with lower mechanical stress

Example:
- Normal week: Bench 80kg, 4×8
- Deload week: Bench 50kg, 4×8

### Option 3: Complete Rest

Sometimes you need a full break. Take 3-7 days off if:
- Lingering injury/pain
- Extreme stress/life demands
- Signs of overtraining

You won't lose muscle in a week—recovery is more important.

## Deload Myths

### "I'll Lose My Gains"

**False.** Muscle loss (atrophy) takes 2-3 weeks of complete inactivity. A deload maintains volume at a lower intensity—plenty to preserve adaptations.

### "I Feel Fine, I Don't Need It"

**Risky.** By the time you "feel" overtrained, you're deep into it. Scheduled deloads prevent this. Think of it like oil changes—you don't wait for the engine to smoke.

### "Deloads Are for Weak People"

**Backwards.** The strongest lifters—powerlifters, weightlifters, bodybuilders—all use deloads. It's how they train hard year-round without breaking down.

## How Buli Handles Deloads

Buli auto-schedules deloads based on:

1. **Cycle-based:** Default 5th week deload after 4 weeks progression
2. **RPE monitoring:** If RPE averages 9+ for 3+ sessions, early deload suggested
3. **Performance tracking:** Missed reps or declining performance triggers recommendation
4. **User override:** Manually trigger deload in settings if needed

During deload week:
- Volume cut 50% (sets reduced)
- Intensity maintained 60-70% of working loads
- Focus on technique refinement
- Optional mobility/recovery work

## Takeaway

Deloads aren't "wasted weeks"—they're strategic recovery that enables long-term progress. Programs without deloads lead to:
- Plateau or regression
- Injury risk
- Burnout

Train hard. Recover harder.
