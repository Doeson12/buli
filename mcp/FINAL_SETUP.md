# ✅ MCP Setup Complete - Ready to Activate!

## What's Been Fixed

All configurations are now correct based on Cursor's official MCP documentation.

### ✅ 1. Package Installed Locally
```bash
@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2025.8.21
```
- Installed as dev dependency in your project
- Also available globally for other projects

### ✅ 2. Project MCP Config Fixed
**Location**: `/Users/john/buli/website/.cursor/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "buli-nextjs": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "${workspaceFolder}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Added `"type": "stdio"` (required for CLI servers)
- ✅ Using `${workspaceFolder}` variable for portability
- ✅ Passing workspace folder as argument to filesystem server

### ✅ 3. Global MCP Config
**Location**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

Same structure but with hardcoded path for when website isn't the active workspace.

### ✅ 4. Project Rules & Context
**Location**: `/Users/john/buli/website/mcp/nextjs.mcp.json`

Contains your project-specific rules and context (not server config).

## 🚀 Step 4: Restart Cursor NOW

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST fully restart Cursor:

1. **Quit Cursor completely**
   ```
   Press: Cmd + Q
   (or: Cursor menu → Quit Cursor)
   ```

2. **Wait 3 seconds**

3. **Reopen Cursor**

4. **Open this project**
   ```
   File → Open → /Users/john/buli/website
   ```

## 🧪 Step 5: Test MCP is Active

### Test 1: Check Available Tools

In Cursor chat, type:
```
List available MCP tools
```

**Expected result:**
```
🧩 Connected MCP servers:
- buli-nextjs (filesystem access)
```

### Test 2: List Project Files

Ask Claude:
```
Show me all files in the components directory
```

**Expected result:**
Claude should list your actual component files without you showing them!

### Test 3: Access Project Context

Ask:
```
What styling approach does this project use?
```

**Expected result:**
Claude should mention Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and your specific patterns automatically.

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

When MCP is working, you'll see:

1. **In Composer/Chat:**
   - "Available Tools" section shows MCP tools
   - Claude can list files without you sharing them

2. **In Cursor Settings:**
   - Settings → Features → Model Context Protocol
   - "buli-nextjs" server should be listed

3. **Better AI Responses:**
   - Claude knows your project structure
   - Suggestions match your coding style
   - No need to manually share files

## 🛠️ If MCP Still Doesn't Work

### Check Cursor Version
```
Help → About Cursor
```
MCP requires **Cursor >= 0.42**

If you're on an older version:
- Update Cursor: Settings → About → Check for Updates

### Check Workspace Trust
Cursor may ask you to trust the workspace:
- Click **"Trust"** when prompted
- MCP servers won't run in untrusted workspaces

### Check Terminal Output
Try running the MCP server manually:
```bash
cd /Users/john/buli/website
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .
```

If it starts without errors, the server works - just need Cursor to connect.

### Check Logs
Look for MCP errors in:
```
~/Library/Logs/Cursor/
```

### Still Not Working?
Share:
1. Your Cursor version
2. Any error messages from logs
3. Whether "Model Context Protocol" appears in Settings → Features
